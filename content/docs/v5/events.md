# Events on Jspreadsheet spreadsheet

## Custom table scripting after changes

Jspreadsheet offers a native feature to customize your table on the go. You can define the method updateTable to create rules to customize the data that should be shown to the user, as the example below.

[See an example in action](/docs/v5/examples/table-scripting)

## Event dispatch

Although you have various specific events, Jspreadsheet has one global event dispatcher that can be used as below.
