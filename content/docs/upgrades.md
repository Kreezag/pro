|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create a new spreadsheet  | Before initializing a new Jspreadsheet instance in the same DOM element, ensure to first destroy any existing spreadsheet.<br>`jspreadsheet(el, spreadsheetOptions)`  |
| Create a new worksheet    | `instance.createWorksheet()`                                                                                                                                          |
| Destroy a spreadsheet     | `jspreadsheet.destroy()` or `worksheetInstance.parent.destroy()`                                                                                                      |
| Destroy all spreadsheets  | `jspradsheet.destroyAll()`                                                                                                                                            | 


### Changes in the Options:

From version 11 you should expect the following changes:

#### Changes in Syntax:

- The notation `jspreadsheet(el, worksheetConfig)` from version 4 is discontinued. Please use: `jspreadsheet(el, spreadsheetConfig)`

#### Configuration Handling:

- Initial default configurations are no longer accessible through `instance.options`. Only explicitly declared or internally generated configurations are retained, optimizing memory usage and facilitating spreadsheet cloning.

## Global Instance Containers

### Spreadsheet Instances

All spreadsheet namespaces and instances are available inside `jspreasheet.spreadsheet`.

### Worksheet Instances

#### window.worksheetName is deprecated and should be dropped in the next version.

Starting with version 11, the use of window.worksheetName for accessing worksheet instances is deprecated and planned for removal in future releases. Version 11 introduces workspaces that allow managing multiple worksheets, even with identical names, and maintaining relationships with other spreadsheets. These worksheets are managed within the workspace scope, eliminating the need for global worksheet instances on the window object.

To access a worksheet instance, use the following methods:

- `worksheetInstance.getWorksheetByName(worksheetName)` to access within the same namespace or
- `jspreadsheet.getWorksheetByName(worksheetName, namespace)` to specify a workspace namespace.

## Worksheets

### Programmatic Methods

| Property                        | Description                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Removed*{.info-label .removed} | Removed: `instance.getWorksheet()`                                                                          |
| *Removed*{.info-label .removed} | Removed: `instance.getWorksheetInstance: (position: number)`. Use: `instance.parent.worksheets[position]`   |
| *New*{.info-label .new}         | Get the worksheet instance by worksheet name `instance.getWorksheetInstanceByName(worksheetName: string)`   |
| *New*{.info-label .new}         | Change worksheet visibility. `instance.setWorksheetState(index, state)`                                     |


## Headers

In the latest update, the internal `headers` structure within Jspreadsheet has been replaced with `cols`. This new structure consolidates all column-related information, including references to the DOM elements of each column, into a single, accessible format.


## Editors

### Type: autocomplete

This attribute has been dropped. You should use `type: 'dropdown'`, with `autocomplete: true`.



## Layout and Accessibility

### Style

It is possible to define a styleId on the columns or rows, or using the A:A or 1:1 name style.

{.ignore}
```javascript
jspreadsheet(document.getElementById('spreadsheet'), {
    worksheets: [{
        minDimensions: [6,6],
        columns: [ { s: 0 }],
    }],
    style: ['background-color: red'],
});
```

### Data Grid Zoom

The data grid now supports zoom-in and zoom-out capabilities, enhancing data visualization and user interaction. [More information](/docs/zoom)

### Data Grid Filters

The filter functionality has seen notable performance improvements when using the filter modal navigation and row filtering process. Starting with version 11, users can navigate through filter modal options using the ArrowUp and ArrowDown keyboard keys and select items using the Tab key. For more tailored filter options, developers can leverage the `onbeforefilter` event to customize the item list upon opening the filter modal.

### Contextmenu

There are new sections on the contextmenu event.

### Fill Handle

- `selectionCopy: boolean` is dropped, please use `fillHandle: boolean`

## Data Grid Selections

Version 11 of Jspreadsheet brings:
- Non-consecutive and multiple selections using CTRL for varied region selection;
- Non-consecutive clipboard operations;
- Methods such as `getSelected` and `getSelectedRows` ignore rows filtered.

These features required adjustments in specific methods to support the new functionalities, as below:

| Method            | Description                                                                                                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `getSelected`     | Signature changed. Returns cell names or an array of coordinates, excluding cells removed by search or filter. |
| `updateSelection` | Deprecated. Use `updateSelectionFromCoords` instead.                                                           |
| `getSelectedRows` | Excludes filtered rows from the results.                                                                       |
| `getHighlighted`  | Outputs an array of data grid selections.                                                                      |
| `getSelection`    | Signature changed. It returns the primary selection, ordered or unordered.                                     | 

## Clipboard

In Version 11, the clipboard handles copying and pasting from non-consecutive selections. So, the `onbeforepaste` and `onpaste` events were updated. These methods now handle arrays of objects when pasting occurs from another spreadsheet and arrays of data when pasting is from an external source. [More Information](/docs/clipboard)


## Formulas

### Formula Picker

The [Formula Selector](/docs/formula-picker) has undergone substantial enhancements to facilitate user interaction.

- Users can now switch between worksheets to define variables or ranges by selecting cells from a different sheet.
- Keyboard navigation has been enabled to assist in range creation.
- Color customizations is now available;
- The advanced formula bar extension now features formula auto-suggestions and supports mouse-based variable selection across different worksheets.

## Features


### Data Grid Search

The `data grid search` feature has been significantly enhanced, offering users much quicker results. Additionally, various events are available for developers that need custom search functionalities.
