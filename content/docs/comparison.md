## More details

 

### Worksheet management

This includes events and actions such as drag-and-drop, deleting or renaming a worksheet, adding a new worksheet button and the context menu.  

### Persistence support

The native persistence features include the internal row id, internal sequences, update row id, saving methods, and persistence plugin integration.  

### Advanced lazyloading

Better DOM management is offered with pagination and lazy loading in the PRO distributions, creating and showing the DOM elements only when needed. From version 8, the lazyloading is based on the viewport and extends the virtual DOM management to the columns.  

### Definitions at a cell level

The Pro distribution allows the developer to define configurations at a cell level, such as masking and format, type, among the other properties available.
