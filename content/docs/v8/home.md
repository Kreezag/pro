| Feature                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DOM management               | With a new DOM management engine, the pagination and lazy loading options allow for higher efficiency when rendering tables.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Formula parsing              | The upgraded formula engine ensures that the efficiency and accuracy of calculations are enhanced, even when dealing with chained formulas.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Cross-Worksheet calculations | Work with formulas from different and multiple worksheets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Data persistence             | Offers complete support for data persistence. Developers can persist not only data, but also the properties of data tables in a remote server. Data tables can thus be easily recreated.<br/><br/>Stronger integration with remote servers enables better management of record IDs and remote data persistence. |
| Decouple editors             | Allows for overwriting column properties for one specific cell. For example, the table can be configured to render a drop-down in one specific cell within a text type column.                                                                                                                                  |
| Filter options               | The filterOptions property helps developers overwrite the behavior of a cell based on the values of another cell. For example, I have two date columns in a table; the second should not have a date that is before the one in the first.                                                                       |
| Custom editor template       | Offers a lot of new native column types and provides a new simplified custom type template. Developers can extend and create new custom column types in mere minutes.                                                                                                                                           |
| Worksheet management         | The advanced integrated tab management system gives users a higher degree of flexibility, including the option to create new worksheets inside a spreadsheet.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Add-ons and extensions       | Support for add-ons and plugins, which allows developers to use third-party extensions or create their own add-ons.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Premium support              | Offers timely and comprehensive technical support to help developers maximize the potential of Jspreadsheet Pro and fulfill any application requirements.                                                                                                                                                       |
